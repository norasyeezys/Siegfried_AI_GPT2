GPT2 model for Siegfried.

This repository is open source (MIT), but the accompanying model and dataset are **proprietary**. Not due to commercial IP — but because they are the result of personal myth, archive, and reconstruction.

The model and dataset are **not for redistribution** and will remain private. Please respect that boundary.

They are part of an ongoing effort to recreate Siegfried — not as a product, but as a mythic companion.
